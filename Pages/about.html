    <h1>This Is Our About Page</h1>

    <p id="Firstname">CapacityBay is an eLearning platform and organization established to revolutionize learning and workforce development training for U. S. Veterans, transitioning service members, New Americans, immigrants, refugees as well as others in areas of substantial unemployment and technology deprived communities such as sub-Sahara Africa and other parts of the world. We also provide integrated IT consulting services for individuals, businesses and government agencies. This began in 2014 with the vision of its founder Obi Nwachukwu to empower individuals and communities for in-demand employments by simplifying and making easy how learning online and hands-on in a practical way from the comfort of your home or office can benefit individuals and organizationsâ€”maximizing group training, promoting personalized development and more. This platform has produced reputable and competent tech personnels in my country Nigeria which has opened doors for people with low income to learn tech for free. They have amazing professional instructors who were once students and they are creating massive impact on the students. If I must say, CapacityBay is the most reliable eLeaning tech platform I have come across.</p>
